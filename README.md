### ABOUT 
This was a game made for the third Blackthornprod game jam (2021) using C# and Unity. Most of the original content can be found within the Assets folder though there were changes made to the Shaders and EditorUserSettings (found in the library folder). For simplicity everything associated with the project has been uploaded to this repository.
