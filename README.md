# minimalist-mastery

### ABOUT 
This was a game made for the third Blackthornprod game jam (2021) using C# and Unity. Most of the original content can be found within the Assets folder. But for simplicity everything associated with the project has been uploaded to this repository.

To run this, it can be played on https://arkicade.itch.io/minimalist-mastery or if you have Unity installed you can create a new project and replace all files inside with whatever is shown in this repository.
